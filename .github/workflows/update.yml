            I found new changes on [GitHubâ€™s Webhooks Event Types & Payloads](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/) and want to let you know about it ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤–

            I can't tell if the changes are fixes, features or breaking changes. You'll have to figure that out on yourself and adapt the commit messages accordingly to trigger the right release, see [our commit message conventions](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.mdhttps://github.com/octokit/webhooks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#merging-the-pull-request--releasing-a-new-version).
