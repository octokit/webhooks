# bin/octokit-types.ts

Generates the singular `schema.d.ts` that provide strict typings for TypeScript
users, based off the `schema.json` generated by `bin/octokit-schema `, and which
is included in the [@octokit/webhooks-types package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/webhooks-types) published from this repo.

Note that this uses `schema.json`, _not_ the individual schemas stored in
`payload-schemas/schemas` - this means you have to regenerate `schema.json`
before running this script for changes to show up.

## Usage
